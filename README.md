# Chat App

A modern Flutter-based chat application that allows users to sign in, exchange messages, and store media in real-time. The app is integrated with Firebase services for authentication, Firestore for real-time messaging, and Firebase Storage for media handling.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports sign-up and login via email/password and Google Sign-In using `firebase_auth` and `google_sign_in`.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly using `cloud_firestore`, and chat statuses (e.g., online, typing) are updated in real time.
- **Media Sharing**: Users can send images using the `image_picker` package, and images are uploaded and stored in Firebase Storage.
- **Custom UI Components**: Implements responsive design using `flutter_screenutil` and `google_fonts` for custom text styles.
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Uses `skeletonizer` for displaying loading placeholders while data is being fetched.
- **App Theming**: Icons are provided through `icons_plus`, and the app supports adaptive UI with both Cupertino and Material design icons.
- **Device Preview**: Debugging across different screen sizes using the `device_preview` package.
- **Animated Swipe Button**: Integrates `swipeable_button_view` for interactive actions like sliding to unlock or send messages.
- **Localization**: Date formatting and internationalization support via the `intl` package.
